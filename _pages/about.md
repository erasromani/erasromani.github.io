I am a second year PhD student at the NYU Center for Data Science, advised by Yiqiu Shen and Carlos Fernandez-Granda. My current research interests center around multimodal learning and its application in cancer screening and early detection. 

Prior to starting the PhD, I led product development as the CTO and co-founder of Tethys AI, a healthcare technology startup. I also holds an M.S. in Data Science from NYU and a B.S. in Engineering Physics from Cornell University. Outside of research, I enjoys scuba diving and sailing.
