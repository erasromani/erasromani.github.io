I am a second-year Ph.D. student at the [NYU Center for Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu/), advised by [Yiqiu Shen](https://seyiqi.github.io/) and [Carlos Fernandez-Granda](https://math.nyu.edu/~cfgranda/). My current research interests center around multimodal learning and its application in cancer screening and early detection.

Prior to starting the Ph.D., I led product development as the CTO and co-founder of [Tethys AI](https://www.tethys.ai/), a healthcare technology startup. I also hold an M.S. in Data Science from [NYU](https://cds.nyu.edu/) and a B.S. in Engineering Physics from [Cornell University](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/aep/).

Outside of research, I enjoy scuba diving and sailing.
