## Abstract

Patient data exist in structured and unstructured formats. Structured data typically contains high level information. In cases where more detailed information is needed, unstructured data retrieval is required. Due to their simplicity, heuristic approaches are typically used to extract insights from the unstructured data sources. In this paper, we limit our scope to MRI radiology reports for breast cancer diagnostic and screening patients. We compare the heuristic approach to deep learning based approaches in their ability to classify the patientâ€™s clinical indications from 500 labeled examples. The deep learning approaches include finetuning of BERT-like models and few-shot learning approaches like prototypical networks. Our results show a 69% improvement in the validation set F1 score when using the finetuning approach over the heuristic baseline.
